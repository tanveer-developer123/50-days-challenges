# ðŸ“– Day 30 â€“ Recap & Project Review

Past 15 days (Day 16â€“30) were a big milestone in my learning journey. In this phase, I moved from just basic Express knowledge to building structured, production-ready APIs with SQLite3.

## âœ… What I Learned

* **SQLite3 Basics â†’ CRUD Operations** â€“ Learned how to design schemas, manage data, and perform queries.
* **Async/Await in Express** â€“ Writing cleaner and non-blocking code.
* **MVC Pattern** â€“ Organized project structure with models, controllers, and routes.
* **RESTful API Design** â€“ Built APIs that follow proper HTTP standards.
* **Database Relationships** â€“ Implemented JOINs and Foreign Keys.
* **File Uploads (Multer)** â€“ Stored files and linked them with DB records.
* **Validation** â€“ Ensured clean and safe inputs with `express-validator`.
* **Pagination, Filtering, Searching** â€“ Optimized APIs for large datasets.
* **Security Enhancements** â€“ Implemented CORS, Helmet.js, and Rate Limiting.
* **Error Handling** â€“ Built a global error handler and created custom error classes for clean responses.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlight â€“ Blog API

I developed a **Blog API Project** using **Express + SQLite3** where I implemented:

* CRUD for blog posts
* File uploads for images
* Validation & error handling
* Pagination, filtering, and search
* Security with headers and rate limiting
* Structured project in MVC pattern

This project gave me a strong foundation and a hands-on understanding of **real-world API development**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Reflection

This phase was not just about coding, but about writing **organized, optimized, and secure applications**. I now feel more confident in building production-ready APIs.

---

## ðŸ”® Next Phase (Preview)

In the next phase, I will focus on:

* **Authentication & Authorization (JWT)**
* **Advanced Security (XSS, CSRF, etc.)**
* **Database Optimization**
* **Bigger Real Projects**

âœ¨ *This 30-day journey improved my skills in backend development, and now I am ready to move to the advanced stage of building secure, scalable, and professional-grade applications.*
